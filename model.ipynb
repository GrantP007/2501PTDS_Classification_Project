         "The central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.",
         "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has changed the definition of Politically-Exposed Persons (PEPs) under its norms, a move that will make it easier for those individuals to carry out various banking transactions, including availing loans.\r\nCertain changes have been made in the RBI’s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.\r\nThe earlier norms pertaining to PEPs were open-ended and there was a lack of clarity on the definition, apparently leading to issues for bankers, parliamentarians and others. There were also concerns in certain quarters that PEPs were finding it difficult to get loans or open bank accounts.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIn the amended KYC master direction, the central bank defines PEPs as “individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, including the heads of states/governments, senior politicians, senior government or judicial or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations and important political party officials”. The new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function.\r\nBank accounts of PEPs have additional KYC norms under the current provisions and special due diligence has to be undertaken by a senior bank official. A sub-clause in the master direction in KYC norms issued by way of a circular on February 25, 2016 has been removed by the central bank.\r\nThe central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.\r\nLast year, the Centre amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to introduce more disclosures for non-government organisations by reporting entities.",

         "Barbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories.",
         "Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfried will be among the presenters at Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards. The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.\r\nOthers taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).\r\nCheck out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list\r\nWednesday’s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here’s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nHow can I watch the Golden Globes?\r\nViewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there’s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it’ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.\r\nJust 3️⃣ MORE DAYS until we are LIVE from the 📍 @beverlyhilton for the 81st Annual #GoldenGlobes!\r\nTune in SUNDAY on @CBS and @paramountplus at 8pm ET/5pm PT pic.twitter.com/SOGznSb9Mt\r\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\r\nWhat’s new with the Golden Globes?\r\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.\r\nWho’s hosting the Globes?\r\nComedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year’s comedy film “Easter Sunday,” will host the Globes. Organizers cited his “infectious energy and relatable humour” in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year’s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.\r\nThe #GoldenGlobes festivities have popped off with @moetchandon! 🍾\r\nTune in THIS Sunday at 8pm ET | 5pm PT on @CBS and stream on @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/T6mYHrW4Ps\r\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\r\nWhat about 60 Minutes?\r\nThe Globes, and New Year’s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.\r\nGolden Globe nominees\r\nBarbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck’s Air, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Todd Haynes’ May December and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu’s The Bear.\r\nDon't Miss | Barbie and Succession lead 2024 Golden Globe nominations, Oppenheimer scores 8 nods\r\nWhat are the Globes known for?\r\nThe Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, and actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.\r\n#GoldenGlobes host, @Jokoy, has been getting ALL the advice! Tune in to the show THIS SUNDAY, Jan 7 @ 8 ET | 5 PT on @CBS and @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/3Y9TshVBMC\r\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\r\nSome years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show — the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nWho votes on the Globes?\r\nThe group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world.\r\nClick for more updates and latest Hollywood News along with Bollywood and Entertainment updates.

         "Citing review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.",
         "Millions of dollars were invested in some publicly traded stocks of India’s Adani Group via “opaque” Mauritius funds that “obscured” involvement of alleged business partners of the Adani family, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) said in an article on Thursday.\r\nCiting review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.\r\nThe OCCRP article comes after U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January accused Adani Group of improper business dealings, including the use of offshore entities in tax havens such as Mauritius from where it said certain offshore funds “surreptitiously” owned stock in Adani’s listed firms.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nAdani Group has called Hindenburg’s claims misleading and without evidence and said it always complied with laws. Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.\r\nIn a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the “allegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg’s allegations.”\r\nMust Read | Hindenburg report probe: Short selling in Adani shares led to ‘gains’ for 12 firms, ED to SEBI\r\n“It is categorically stated that all the Adani Group’s publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,” it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.\r\nReuters has not independently verified OCCRP’s assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\r\nHindenburg saga, regulatory probe \r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world’s third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.\r\nIndia’s Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far “drawn a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.\r\nLast week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator “shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,” it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article – Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling – described by OCCRP as “longtime business partners” of the Adani family.\r\nExplained | SEBI seeks more time on Adani-Hindenburg report: The case so far\r\nThe media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli’s money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents – including an agreement, corporate records and an email – showed there “is evidence” that their trading in Adani stock “was coordinated with the family.”\r\n“The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‘promoters,’ a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,” OCCRP said.\r\nExpress Investigation | Exposed & shut, Panama Papers law firm outsourced its offshore deals to Kerala accountant; ED probe on\r\nIf so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP’s requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.\r\nIn an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, “We are a simple business.”",

         "India's demand for electricity for running household air conditioners is estimated to expand nine-fold by 2050 and will exceed total power consumption in the whole of Africa today, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.",
         "nrIndia’s demand for electricity for running household air conditioners is estimated to expand nine-fold by 2050 and will exceed total power consumption in the whole of Africa today, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.\r\nIn its latest World Energy Outlook, IEA said India will see the largest energy demand growth of any country or region in the world over the next three decades.\r\nIt projected India’s energy supply to rise from 42 exajoules (EJ) in 2022 to 53.7 EJ in 2030 and 73 EJ in 2050 under stated policies scenarios and 47.6 EJ by 2030 and 60.3 EJ by 2050 as per announced pledges.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nOil demand is seen rising from 5.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 to 6.8 million bpd in 2030 and 7.8 million bpd in 2050 under stated policies scenario. Under announced pledges, this demand is seeking 6.2 million bpd in 2030 and 4.7 million bpd in 2050.\r\nIEA said over the past five decades, India witnessed over 700 heatwave events, which have claimed over 17,000 lives. Fuelled by its geographic and meteorological conditions, air conditioner ownership in India has been steadily rising with growing incomes, tripling since 2010 to reach 24 units per 100 households.\r\n“The impact of cooling needs on electricity consumption is already clear,” the Paris-based agency said.\r\n“Electricity demand is sensitive to temperatures, and in India’s case there is a sharp increase in demand as temperatures cross the 25-degree Celsius threshold..\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nElectricity consumption due to space cooling increased 21 per cent between 2019 and 2022, and today nearly 10 per cent of electricity demand comes from space cooling requirements.\r\n“Household air conditioner ownership is estimated to expand ninefold by 2050 across the IEA scenarios, outpacing the growth in ownership of every other major household appliance including televisions, refrigerators and washing machines,” it said.\r\n“Residential electricity demand from cooling increases ninefold in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) by 2050..\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIEA said by 2050, “India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners in the STEPS exceeds total electricity consumption in the whole of Africa today..\r\nIn the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), however, electricity demand for air conditioners is nearly 15 per cent lower in 2050 as it is in the STEPS as a result of increased use of energy-efficient air conditioners and thermal insulation in buildings. “This reduction itself is larger than the total electricity generation by several countries today, such as that of the Netherlands”.\r\nThe growth in ownership and use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment is one of the key drivers of the increase in peak electricity demand in India.\r\nIn the STEPS, peak electricity demand rise around 60 per cent from the 2022 level by 2030 and cooling accounts for nearly half of this increase.\r\nIn the APS, however, the implementation of building codes, the use of more efficient appliances and the adoption of demand response measures enable the same cooling needs to be met with less energy. This reduces peak electricity demand growth by nearly one-quarter compared to the STEPS. Given that the electricity system is sized to meet peak demand, lower peak demand helps to lower electricity investment needs and system costs.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nAlthough solar PV matches well with daytime cooling needs, cooling demand is also significant in India during the late evening and at night.\r\n“Lowering cooling demand through energy efficiency policies therefore reduces the need for investment in batteries or expensive standby generation capacity, and thus helps to integrate renewables more cost effectively,” IEA said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIEA said India is moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition, increased regulatory sophistication, a focus on clean energy deployment, and the creation of domestic clean energy technology supply chains.\r\nRecognising the potential to transform its energy sector and reduce the import burden of fossil fuels while reducing CO2 emissions, India has announced a net zero emissions target by 2070, and has put in place policies to scale up clean energy supply and clean technology manufacturing.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“While clean energy investment in India more than doubles in the STEPS by 2030 from around USD 60 billion in 2022, investment needs to nearly triple by the end of this decade to be on a trajectory to meet its net zero emissions target, which is reflected in the APS,” it said.\r\nAlthough India’s population growth has slowed to reach replacement levels, its urban population increases by 74 per cent and per capita income triples by 2050. Industrial output expands rapidly, for example through a tripling of output of iron and steel, and doubling of cement, plus there is a ninefold increase in residential air conditioner ownership by 2050.\r\n“As a result, demand for oil and natural gas increases in the STEPS by nearly 70 per cent between 2022 and 2050, while coal demand increases by 10 per cent, even as solar PV makes inroads into electricity generation. As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions still rise nearly 30 per cent by 2050, which is one of the largest increases in the world,” the outlook said.\r\nIn the APS, the increase in clean energy investment changes the outlook. In the STEPS, solar provides nearly 45 per cent of total generated power by 2050; in the APS, it crosses 50 per cent. In both the STEPS and APS, India achieves its target of 50 per cent non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030.\r\nClean energy investment in the APS over and above those in the STEPS also drives faster growth in electromobility, low-emissions hydrogen, grid expansions and other clean energy infrastructure.\r\n“As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions fall sharply in the APS by over 40 per cent from current levels by 2050, even though its GDP quadruples over this period,” it added.",

Fuelled by its geographic and meteorological conditions, air conditioner ownership in India has been steadily rising with growing incomes, tripling since 2010 to reach 24 units per 100 households.\r\n“The impact of cooling needs on electricity consumption is already clear,” the Paris-based agency said.\r\n“Electricity demand is sensitive to temperatures, and in India’s case there is a sharp increase in demand as temperatures cross the 25-degree Celsius threshold..\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nElectricity consumption due to space cooling increased 21 per cent between 2019 and 2022, and today nearly 10 per cent of electricity demand comes from space cooling requirements.\r\n“Household air conditioner ownership is estimated to expand ninefold by 2050 across the IEA scenarios, outpacing the growth in ownership of every other major household appliance including televisions, refrigerators and washing machines,” it said.\r\n“Residential electricity demand from cooling increases ninefold in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) by 2050..\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIEA said by 2050, “India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners in the STEPS exceeds total electricity consumption in the whole of Africa today..\r\nIn the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), however, electricity demand for air conditioners is nearly 15 per cent lower in 2050 as it is in the STEPS as a result of increased use of energy-efficient air conditioners and thermal insulation in buildings. “This reduction itself is larger than the total electricity generation by several countries today, such as that of the Netherlands”.\r\nThe growth in ownership and use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment is one of the key drivers of the increase in peak electricity demand in India.\r\nIn the STEPS, peak electricity demand rise around 60 per cent from the 2022 level by 2030 and cooling accounts for nearly half of this increase.\r\nIn the APS, however, the implementation of building codes, the use of more efficient appliances and the adoption of demand response measures enable the same cooling needs to be met with less energy. This reduces peak electricity demand growth by nearly one-quarter compared to the STEPS. Given that the electricity system is sized to meet peak demand, lower peak demand helps to lower electricity investment needs and system costs.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nAlthough solar PV matches well with daytime cooling needs, cooling demand is also significant in India during the late evening and at night.\r\n“Lowering cooling demand through energy efficiency policies therefore reduces the need for investment in batteries or expensive standby generation capacity, and thus helps to integrate renewables more cost effectively,” IEA said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIEA said India is moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition, increased regulatory sophistication, a focus on clean energy deployment, and the creation of domestic clean energy technology supply chains.\r\nRecognising the potential to transform its energy sector and reduce the import burden of fossil fuels while reducing CO2 emissions, India has announced a net zero emissions target by 2070, and has put in place policies to scale up clean energy supply and clean technology manufacturing.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“While clean energy investment in India more than doubles in the STEPS by 2030 from around USD 60 billion in 2022, investment needs to nearly triple by the end of this decade to be on a trajectory to meet its net zero emissions target, which is reflected in the APS,” it said.\r\nAlthough India’s population growth has slowed to reach replacement levels, its urban population increases by 74 per cent and per capita income triples by 2050. Industrial output expands rapidly, for example through a tripling of output of iron and steel, and doubling of cement, plus there is a ninefold increase in residential air conditioner ownership by 2050.\r\n“As a result, demand for oil and natural gas increases in the STEPS by nearly 70 per cent between 2022 and 2050, while coal demand increases by 10 per cent, even as solar PV makes inroads into electricity generation. As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions still rise nearly 30 per cent by 2050, which is one of the largest increases in the world,” the outlook said.\r\nIn the APS, the increase in clean energy investment changes the outlook. In the STEPS, solar provides nearly 45 per cent of total generated power by 2050; in the APS, it crosses 50 per cent. In both the STEPS and APS, India achieves its target of 50 per cent non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030.\r\nClean energy investment in the APS over and above those in the STEPS also drives faster growth in electromobility, low-emissions hydrogen, grid expansions and other clean energy infrastructure.\r\n“As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions fall sharply in the APS by over 40 per cent from current levels by 2050, even though its GDP quadruples over this period,” it added.",

         "The rupee depreciated by 2 paise and settled for the day at an all-time low of 83.12 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, weighed down by a surge in crude oil prices and selling pressure by foreign investors.\r\nForex traders said rupee is likely to trade with a negative bias on risk aversion in global markets.\r\nAt the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.10 against the US dollar and moved in a range of 83.05 to 83.13 in the day trade.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe rupee finally settled at 83.12 (provisional) against the US dollar, down 2 paise from its previous close.\r\nOn Friday, the rupee edged lower by 1 paisa to settle at an all-time low of 83.10 against the US dollar, weighed down by a negative trend in domestic equities, and foreign fund outflows.\r\nThe Indian rupee depreciated on a surge in crude oil prices and selling pressure by foreign investors.\r\nHowever, the weak tone in US dollar and positive domestic markets cushioned the downside, said Anuj Choudhary – Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe US dollar declined after the Chinese central bank reduced a key rate by 10 basis points to 3.45 per cent to stimulate the economy leading to risk on sentiments.\r\n“We expect the rupee to trade with a negative bias on rising global crude oil prices and overall strength in the US dollar amid the hawkish US Federal Reserve. However, positive domestic markets and any intervention by the Reserve Bank of India may support rupee at lower levels. USDINR spot price is expected to trade in a range of Rs 82.80 to Rs 83.50,” Choudhary added.\r\nMost investors will be taking cues from the BRICS summit and the Jackson Hole Symposium, traders said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nMeanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.14 per cent to 103.23.\r\nBrent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, advanced 0.64 per cent to USD 85.34 per barrel.\r\nOn the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE Sensex closed 267.43 points or 0.41 per cent higher at 65,216.09. The broader NSE Nifty advanced 83.45 points or 0.43 per cent to 19,393.60.\r\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Friday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 266.98 crore, according to exchange data.\r\nMeanwhile, India’s foreign exchange reserves jumped USD 708 million to USD 602.161 billion for the week ended August 11, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Friday.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThis is the first increase in the kitty after declining for three consecutive weeks. In the previous week, the overall reserves had declined USD 2.417 billion to USD 601.453 billion.",

         "While asking the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) what it intends to do in future to ensure investors don't loose wealth due to volatility in stock market or short-selling, the apex court observed it would not be proper for it to set up a special investigation team (SIT) on its own without any material before it.",
         "The Supreme Court on Friday said it has no reason to “discredit” SEBI, which probed allegations against the Adani group, as there was no material before it to doubt what the market regulator has done and the court does not have to treat what was set out in the Hindenburg report as a “true state of affairs”.\r\nWhile asking the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) what it intends to do in future to ensure investors don’t loose wealth due to volatility in stock market or short-selling, the apex court observed it would not be proper for it to set up a special investigation team (SIT) on its own without any material before it.\r\nA bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, which reserved its order on a batch of pleas concerning the Adani-Hindenburg row on allegations of stock price manipulation, said it cannot ask a statutory regulator to take as a “gospel truth” something which was published in the media.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“We don’t have to treat what is set out in the Hindenburg report as ipso facto (automatically) a true state of affairs. That is why we directed the SEBI to investigate. Because for us to accept something which is in the report of an entity, which in not before us and whose veracity we have no means of testing, would really be unfair,” the bench, also comprising justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for one of the petitioners.\r\nBhushan argued that SEBI’s role in the matter was “suspect” for several reasons because a lot of information was available to the regulator way back in 2014.\r\n“They have completed their investigations. They are saying that is now in their quasi-judicial power. Should they disclose the investigation before they issue a notice to show cause,” the bench asked.\r\nBhushan said it was for the apex court to see whether the probe done by the SEBI was credible or not and whether some other independent organisation or an SIT was needed to be formed to investigate it.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“Where is the material before us for us to doubt what SEBI has done,” the bench observed.\r\nIt also took serious note of Bhushan’s claim that two of the members of the apex court appointed expert committee have serious “conflict of interest”.\r\nThe bench said there has to be some responsibility about the allegations being made as it was easy to level allegations.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“You have to also be very careful. It is very easy to make allegations. We are not here giving a character certificate. But equally we have to be conscious about fundamental principles of fairness,” the bench observed.\r\nDealing with the submissions relating to SEBI probe, it said, “We have to be also conscious that SEBI is a statutory body exclusively entrusted with the jurisdiction to investigate into stock market violations. Today, is it proper for a court, the highest court, to just without any material to say that we will not let you investigate and we will constitute a SIT of our own? This has to be done with a great deal of calibration.” Bhushan referred to the Hindenburg report as also some media report to buttress his arguments that SEBI’s probe was not credible.\r\n“I don’t think you can ask a statutory regulator to take as a gospel truth something which is filed in a newspaper, whether in the Guardian or the Financial Times. We have no reason to discredit them…,” the bench said.\r\n“Therefore, should SEBI be following up journalists and ask a journalist, who is not subject to their jurisdiction, to disclose the underlying materials,” it said.\r\nBhushan argued that if a journalist can get hold of documents, how can the SEBI, with all its vast powers of investigation, not being able to get hold of these materials.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe bench said there was always a correct way of looking at it for a simple reason that when “you are dealing with a body which is governed by evidentiary requirements… somebody who publishes something in the public realm, is not bound by the evidentiary standards with which a statutory body is bound”.\r\n“They are amenable to jurisdiction of the security appellate tribunal. You can’t pick out and say well, I will rely on newspaper report and issue a notice of show cause. That notice will be quashed by a judicial body,” it said.\r\nBhushan said the show cause notice would not be quashed if it was based on credible information which leads to suspicion.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“As a court, how do we treat it as credible? We will have to rely on our investigative agencies to investigate it,” the bench said, adding, “We can’t make that assumption that it is either credible or lacking in credibility”.\r\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the SEBI, told the bench that there was “a growing tendency of planting stories outside India to influence things and policies inside India”.\r\nAt the outset, Mehta apprised the bench that investigation in 22 out of the 24 cases relating to allegations against the Adani group were over.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nA Supreme Court-appointed expert committee had in an interim report in May stated that it saw “no evident pattern of manipulation” in billionaire Gautam Adani’s companies and there was no regulatory failure.\r\nThe Adani Group stocks had been bludgeoned on the bourses after Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including those about fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate.\r\nThe Adani Group dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.",

         "In its annual report for FY23, the largest private sector lender said the CEO was paid a basic salary of Rs 2.82 crore, allowances and perquisites of Rs 3.31 crore, a provident fund of Rs 33.92 lakh and a performance bonus of Rs 3.63 crore",
         "HDFC Bank managing director and chief executive Sashidhar Jagdishan’s remuneration shot up by over 62 per cent in FY23 to Rs 10.55 crore in FY23.\r\nIn its annual report for FY23, the largest private sector lender said deputy managing director Kaizad Bharucha’s overall remuneration, excluding stock options, was Rs 10.03 crore.\r\nJagdishan was paid Rs 6.52 crore in FY22, while Bharucha was paid Rs 10.64 crore in the year-ago period, the report said, adding the percentage increase in median remuneration of employees was 2.51 per cent.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe CEO was paid a basic salary of Rs 2.82 crore, allowances and perquisites of Rs 3.31 crore, a provident fund of Rs 33.92 lakh and a performance bonus of Rs 3.63 crore, the report said.\r\nGoing forward, the key personnel of the lender will play an important role as they will be steering a large institution after the merger of mortgage major parent HDFC with HDFC Bank.\r\nIn his message to shareholders, Jagdishan said the merger will help the lender to take a larger exposure in infrastructure projects with the help of a much bigger balancesheet.\r\nWith its digital platforms, digital journeys and physical branch network, HDFC Bank will have the ability to offer the home loan customer a complete bouquet of the Bank’s and subsidiaries’ products and services, he said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“Savings accounts, personal loans, insurance cover, SIPs can all be bundled along with a home loan to create a compelling value proposition to the customer, that probably does not exist in the market at the scale at which this is envisaged,” Jagdishan said.\r\nMeanwhile, he expressed concerns over the attrition rate at the bank, which had over 1.70 lakh employees at the end of March 2023.\r\nThe bank’s attrition rate was at 34.15 per cent in FY23, as against an industry average of 24.7 per cent. A total of 53,760 employees quit the bank in FY23, while 85,814 were added.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“The bank has experienced an increase in attrition over the last financial year and a significant part of which was in the ‘non-supervisory staff’ levels (which includes sales officers),” Jagdishan said, attributing the same to a post-COVID phenomenon, which may have prompted the younger workforce to recalibrate what they ‘want from their lives’.\r\nJagdishan said he wants to focus on building an inclusive organisation, which will go a long way in reining in attrition in the coming years and also seemed to be referring to lapses on the cultural front like the unsavoury conduct of a senior manager during a business review meeting recently.\r\n“I am fully conscious of the fact that there may be instances where some people managers might transgress our defined way of working. We have the resolve to nip this in the bud, both by way of training/counselling and appropriate action, to ensure that the same is not attempted by anyone else. Having said that, we have some distance to traverse on this front,” he said.\r\nJagdishan said the bank is focusing on diversity, and plans to take the overall share of women in its workforce to 25 per cent by end of FY25 from the current 23 per cent.\r\nThe bank, which had invited unprecedented regulatory actions due to laxities on the technology front, has seen a significant improvement in its resilience and uptime metrics, Jagdishan said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIt has migrated data centres to new state-of-the-art facilities in Mumbai and Bengaluru, he added.\r\nThe trend in complaints indicates that digital frauds are increasing, particularly targeting a vulnerable section of consumers, he said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIt plans to add another 1,500 to 2,000 branches in FY24, which will include 575 units in semi-urban and rural areas, he said.",

         "HDFC Bank managing director and chief executive Sashidhar Jagdishan’s remuneration shot up by over 62 per cent in FY23 to Rs 10.55 crore in FY23.\r\nIn its annual report for FY23, the largest private sector lender said deputy managing director Kaizad Bharucha’s overall remuneration, excluding stock options, was Rs 10.03 crore.\r\nJagdishan was paid Rs 6.52 crore in FY22, while Bharucha was paid Rs 10.64 crore in the year-ago period, the report said, adding the percentage increase in median remuneration of employees was 2.51 per cent.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe CEO was paid a basic salary of Rs 2.82 crore, allowances and perquisites of Rs 3.31 crore, a provident fund of Rs 33.92 lakh and a performance bonus of Rs 3.63 crore, the report said.\r\nGoing forward, the key personnel of the lender will play an important role as they will be steering a large institution after the merger of mortgage major parent HDFC with HDFC Bank.\r\nIn his message to shareholders, Jagdishan said the merger will help the lender to take a larger exposure in infrastructure projects with the help of a much bigger balancesheet.\r\nWith its digital platforms, digital journeys and physical branch network, HDFC Bank will have the ability to offer the home loan customer a complete bouquet of the Bank’s and subsidiaries’ products and services, he said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“Savings accounts, personal loans, insurance cover, SIPs can all be bundled along with a home loan to create a compelling value proposition to the customer, that probably does not exist in the market at the scale at which this is envisaged,” Jagdishan said.\r\nMeanwhile, he expressed concerns over the attrition rate at the bank, which had over 1.70 lakh employees at the end of March 2023.\r\nThe bank’s attrition rate was at 34.15 per cent in FY23, as against an industry average of 24.7 per cent. A total of 53,760 employees quit the bank in FY23, while 85,814 were added.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n“The bank has experienced an increase in attrition over the last financial year and a significant part of which was in the ‘non-supervisory staff’ levels (which includes sales officers),” Jagdishan said, attributing the same to a post-COVID phenomenon, which may have prompted the younger workforce to recalibrate what they ‘want from their lives’.\r\nJagdishan said he wants to focus on building an inclusive organisation, which will go a long way in reining in attrition in the coming years and also seemed to be referring to lapses on the cultural front like the unsavoury conduct of a senior manager during a business review meeting recently.\r\n“I am fully conscious of the fact that there may be instances where some people managers might transgress our defined way of working. We have the resolve to nip this in the bud, both by way of training/counselling and appropriate action, to ensure that the same is not attempted by anyone else. Having said that, we have some distance to traverse on this front,” he said.\r\nJagdishan said the bank is focusing on diversity, and plans to take the overall share of women in its workforce to 25 per cent by end of FY25 from the current 23 per cent.\r\nThe bank, which had invited unprecedented regulatory actions due to laxities on the technology front, has seen a significant improvement in its resilience and uptime metrics, Jagdishan said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIt has migrated data centres to new state-of-the-art facilities in Mumbai and Bengaluru, he added.\r\nThe trend in complaints indicates that digital frauds are increasing, particularly targeting a vulnerable section of consumers, he said.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIt plans to add another 1,500 to 2,000 branches in FY24, which will include 575 units in semi-urban and rural areas, he said.",

         "Capital markets regulator Sebi has notified rules allowing private equity funds to sponsor a mutual fund house as they can bring in strategic guidance and talent to drive the growth of the industry.\r\nCurrently, any entity that owns 40 per cent or more stake in a mutual fund is considered a sponsor and is required to fulfill the eligibility criteria.\r\n“A private equity fund or a pooled investment vehicle or a pooled investment fund may also be permitted to sponsor mutual funds,” Sebi said in a notification adding that this is subject to certain conditions.\r\nUnder the eligibility criteria for the sponsor of MF, Sebi said that sponsors need to adequately capitalise the asset management company (AMC) such that the positive liquid net worth of AMC should be at least Rs 150 crore.\r\nIn addition, the capital contributed to the AMC would be locked in for 5 years, besides, the minimum sponsor stake of 40 per cent would also be locked in for five years, according to the notification issued on Monday.\r\nFurther, the regulator said that “Self Sponsored AMCs” can continue the mutual fund business. This is subject to AMCs fulfilling certain conditions. The move would give the original sponsor flexibility to voluntarily disassociate itself from the MF without needing to induct a new and eligible sponsor.\r\nIn addition, the regulator has increased the role and accountability of the trustees in a bid to safeguard unitholders’ interests. Also, the regulator enhanced the accountability of the board of AMC.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nFurther, the regulator said that a unitholder protection committee (UHPC) by the board of an AMC would be constituted. This is part of Sebi’s attempt to have an independent review mechanism for the decisions of AMC from the perspective of the unitholders’ interest across all products and services.\r\nTo give this effect, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has amended mutual fund rules.",

         "Capital markets regulator Sebi has notified rules allowing private equity funds to sponsor a mutual fund house as they can bring in strategic guidance and talent to drive the growth of the industry.\r\nCurrently, any entity that owns 40 per cent or more stake in a mutual fund is considered a sponsor and is required to fulfill the eligibility criteria.\r\n“A private equity fund or a pooled investment vehicle or a pooled investment fund may also be permitted to sponsor mutual funds,” Sebi said in a notification adding that this is subject to certain conditions.\r\nUnder the eligibility criteria for the sponsor of MF, Sebi said that sponsors need to adequately capitalise the asset management company (AMC) such that the positive liquid net worth of AMC should be at least Rs 150 crore.\r\nIn addition, the capital contributed to the AMC would be locked in for 5 years, besides, the minimum sponsor stake of 40 per cent would also be locked in for five years, according to the notification issued on Monday.\r\nFurther, the regulator said that “Self Sponsored AMCs” can continue the mutual fund business. This is subject to AMCs fulfilling certain conditions. The move would give the original sponsor flexibility to voluntarily disassociate itself from the MF without needing to induct a new and eligible sponsor.\r\nIn addition, the regulator has increased the role and accountability of the trustees in a bid to safeguard unitholders’ interests. Also, the regulator enhanced the accountability of the board of AMC.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nFurther, the regulator said that a unitholder protection committee (UHPC) by the board of an AMC would be constituted. This is part of Sebi’s attempt to have an independent review mechanism for the decisions of AMC from the perspective of the unitholders’ interest across all products and services.\r\nTo give this effect, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has amended mutual fund rules.",

         "The prices of gold opened marginally higher and that of silver slipped in the key spot markets on Wednesday.\r\nThe opening price for 999 purity (24 Karat) gold was Rs 60,603 per 10 grams on Wednesday, up by Rs 24 from Tuesday’s closing price of Rs 60,579 per 10 grams, while that of 999 purity silver was Rs 70,228 per kg up by Rs 477 from 70,705, per kg, according to the data available with India Bullion and Jewellers Association’s (IBJA).\r\nBullion Purity Opening price (Rs) Previous close (Rs)\r\nGold (10 gm) 999 60603 60579\r\n995 60360 60336\r\n916 55512 55490\r\n750 45452 45434\r\n585 35453 35439\r\nSilver (1 kg) 999 70228 70705\r\n(Source: India Bullion and Jewellers Association’s (IBJA))\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nSpot gold remained unchanged at $1,968.11 per ounce by 0247 GMT after sinking to its lowest since October 24 on Tuesday. The US gold futures were changed a bit at $1,974.70.\r\nAccording to Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive, the geopolitical risk premium is getting digested out. “As central banks turned away from rate hikes, it is ultimately pushing yields lower. So, there’s not much of driving catalysts for gold this week,” Spivak said.\r\nMost of the Fed officials on Tuesday refrained from giving out a hint about the central bank’s next decision, but noted they would focus on more economic data and the impact of higher long-term bond yields.\r\nAs per the according to the CME, FedWatch tool, futures point to a roughly 15% chance of another rate hike by January. There’s a 20% chance that cuts could come as early as March, it predicted.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nElsewhere, spot silver dropped 0.3% to $22.55 per ounce, while platinum rose by 0.1% to $890.42. Palladium slipped 0.8% to $1,047.03, its lowest since October 2018.\r\n–With inputs from Reuters",

         "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has changed the definition of Politically-Exposed Persons (PEPs) under its norms, a move that will make it easier for those individuals to carry out various banking transactions, including availing loans.\r\nCertain changes have been made in the RBI’s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.\r\nThe earlier norms pertaining to PEPs were open-ended and there was a lack of clarity on the definition, apparently leading to issues for bankers, parliamentarians and others. There were also concerns in certain quarters that PEPs were finding it difficult to get loans or open bank accounts.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nIn the amended KYC master direction, the central bank defines PEPs as “individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, including the heads of states/governments, senior politicians, senior government or judicial or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations and important political party officials”. The new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function.\r\nBank accounts of PEPs have additional KYC norms under the current provisions and special due diligence has to be undertaken by a senior bank official. A sub-clause in the master direction in KYC norms issued by way of a circular on February 25, 2016 has been removed by the central bank.\r\nThe central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.\r\nLast year, the Centre amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to introduce more disclosures for non-government organisations by reporting entities.",

The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.\r\nOthers taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).\r\nCheck out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list\r\nWednesday’s announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here’s more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nHow can I watch the Golden Globes?\r\nViewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there’s an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it’ll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.\r\nJust 3️⃣ MORE DAYS until we are LIVE from the 📍 @beverlyhilton for the 81st Annual #GoldenGlobes!\r\nTune in SUNDAY on @CBS and @paramountplus at 8pm ET/5pm PT pic.twitter.com/SOGznSb9Mt\r\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\r\nWhat’s new with the Golden Globes?\r\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.\r\nWho’s hosting the Globes?\r\nComedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year’s comedy film “Easter Sunday,” will host the Globes. Organizers cited his “infectious energy and relatable humour” in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year’s emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.\r\nThe #GoldenGlobes festivities have popped off with @moetchandon! 🍾\r\nTune in THIS Sunday at 8pm ET | 5pm PT on @CBS and stream on @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/T6mYHrW4Ps\r\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\r\nWhat about 60 Minutes?\r\nThe Globes, and New Year’s Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.\r\nGolden Globe nominees\r\nBarbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Celine Song’s Past Lives, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck’s Air, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Todd Haynes’ May December and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu’s The Bear.\r\nDon't Miss | Barbie and Succession lead 2024 Golden Globe nominations, Oppenheimer scores 8 nods\r\nWhat are the Globes known for?\r\nThe Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, and actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.\r\n#GoldenGlobes host, @Jokoy, has been getting ALL the advice! Tune in to the show THIS SUNDAY, Jan 7 @ 8 ET | 5 PT on @CBS and @paramountplus! pic.twitter.com/3Y9TshVBMC\r\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024\r\nSome years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show — the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nWho votes on the Globes?\r\nThe group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world.\r\nClick for more updates and latest Hollywood News along with Bollywood and Entertainment updates.

         "Millions of dollars were invested in some publicly traded stocks of India’s Adani Group via “opaque” Mauritius funds that “obscured” involvement of alleged business partners of the Adani family, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) said in an article on Thursday.\r\nCiting review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.\r\nThe OCCRP article comes after U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January accused Adani Group of improper business dealings, including the use of offshore entities in tax havens such as Mauritius from where it said certain offshore funds “surreptitiously” owned stock in Adani’s listed firms.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nAdani Group has called Hindenburg’s claims misleading and without evidence and said it always complied with laws. Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.\r\nIn a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the “allegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg’s allegations.”\r\nMust Read | Hindenburg report probe: Short selling in Adani shares led to ‘gains’ for 12 firms, ED to SEBI\r\n“It is categorically stated that all the Adani Group’s publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,” it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.\r\nReuters has not independently verified OCCRP’s assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\r\nHindenburg saga, regulatory probe \r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world’s third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.\r\nIndia’s Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far “drawn a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.\r\nLast week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator “shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,” it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nThe OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article – Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling – described by OCCRP as “longtime business partners” of the Adani family.\r\nExplained | SEBI seeks more time on Adani-Hindenburg report: The case so far\r\nThe media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli’s money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents – including an agreement, corporate records and an email – showed there “is evidence” that their trading in Adani stock “was coordinated with the family.”\r\n“The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‘promoters,’ a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,” OCCRP said.\r\nExpress Investigation | Exposed & shut, Panama Papers law firm outsourced its offshore deals to Kerala accountant; ED probe on\r\nIf so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP’s requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.\r\nIn an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, “We are a simple business.”",
